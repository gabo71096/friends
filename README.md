# Friends

This is just a tutorial project to demonstrate CRUD operations on Ruby on Rails!  
You just have to Sign up, Log in and start managing your friends list and your profile.

# Try it

If you want to try it you should have:

-RVM installed (https://rvm.io/rvm/install) for managing Ruby, Ruby on Rails install.  
-Node.js (https://nodejs.org/es/).  
-Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).  
-SQLite3 (https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).

After cloning repo, cd into the folder, run "rails db:migrate", then "rails webpacker:install", and it should be OK to start.

To start server, just execute the command "rails s" and it will initialize.
